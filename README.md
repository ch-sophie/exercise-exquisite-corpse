## The story of a little bean

**Once upon a time**, there was a small red bean named _Redy_, who was loved by everyone who saw her.  
The little red bean lives on the side of the road, in the village of RedBeans.  
Everyday, the people walking by carry _Redy_ on a walk in the village.  
 
  > I have travelled so many times. 
  >> I am so glad there are many people coming in the village.
